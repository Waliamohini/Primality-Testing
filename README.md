Primality Testing with Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various algorithms for determining whether a given number is prime. Prime numbers are fundamental in number theory and have numerous applications in cryptography, computer science, and mathematics.

Included Algorithms:

Trial Division: A basic method that checks divisibility by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of the number.
Sieve of Eratosthenes: An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.
Miller-Rabin Test: A probabilistic primality test that is highly accurate and efficient for large numbers.
Fermat's Little Theorem: A probabilistic primality test based on Fermat's Little Theorem.
Features:

Clear and well-commented code for easy understanding.
Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementations.
Performance analysis to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
Additional optimizations and enhancements for improved performance.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the desired Python script to perform primality testing.
Input the number you want to check for primality.
The script will output whether the number is prime or composite.
Contributions:

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or improvements to the code.
